# Developing / Contributing

**There are many ways you can contribute to help make HASS.Agent better for everyone.**

## Low/No-code ways to help out

There are lots of ways to help out with HASS.Agent, even if you can't code. Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

- Submitting Github issues whenever you find an error or problem with any aspect of HASS.Agent. Use [this](reporting-issues.md) guide for more info.
- Helping other users of HASS.Agent with setup and usage. You can help other users in our discord server [here](https://discord.gg/JfZj98xqJr){: target="\_blank"}.
- Adding and updating everything found here in the HASS.Agent Documentation. More info can be found [below](#helping-out-with-the-documentation).
- Translating HASS.Agent's app and documentation to reach more people. There is a specific guide for this, which you can find [here](translating/index.md).

## Programming / Developing

If you are a programmer and want to help out check out these sections:

- [C#](#c-and-windows-apps)
- [Python](#python-and-homeassistant-integrations)

### C# and windows apps

If you have experience in C# and creating native windows applications, we could use your help with creating the HASS.Agent client and Satellite service. If you would like to learn more, check out the dedicated section [here](app/index.md).

### Python and Homeassistant integrations

If you have experience in python and creating homeassistant integrations, you can help us develop the HACS integration that connects to HASS.Agent. If you would like to learn more, check out the dedicated section [here](integration/index.md).

## Helping out with the Documentation

You don't need to be a programmer or developer to help out with the documentation. 99% of the documentation is written in markdown, which is a very easy and widely used markup language to add formatting to plain text. If you would like to learn more about markdown click [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/){: target="\_blank"}.

There are three main ways you can edit the documentation:

- **Easiest Way:** The easiest way to contribute is to submit github issues or message developers in the discord server to have them make the edits for you, more info on this [here](./reporting-issues.md).
- **Simple Markdown Way:** There is an easy markdown editor hosted by github that you can use to make small changes to pages, find info on that [here](./docs/easy-editing.md).
- **Local/Full Project:** If you want to add new pages or features and test changes locally you can use docker and VSCode to edit the documentation, more info [here](./docs/index.md).
