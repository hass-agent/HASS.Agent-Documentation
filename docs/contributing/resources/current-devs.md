# Current Code Maintainers

Here you can find the list of current developers and what they help contribute. You will find discord and github links if you need to contact them for help with development.

!!! warning

    **Do not spam**
    We have given you these links so you can use them correctly and to get help, they are not for you to message about some small issue that the rest of the community can help with. If you need help with their specific contributions or need to message the lead devs you can use the links in the tabs below.

??? question "Get added to this list"

    If you actively maintain the codebase for a week or more, head over to the Discord server and ask one of the lead devs to verify you and add you to this list.
