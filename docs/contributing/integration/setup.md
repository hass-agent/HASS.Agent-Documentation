### Dev Container

#### Open the container to view files

If you open up the vscode project with your dev HA you will automatically be opened to the dev container's files.

#### Start HA

To start HA in VSCode you can use ++ctrl+shift+p++, and then search for `run task` and then search for `run home assistant core`. This will startup the container on the port(default is 8123)
